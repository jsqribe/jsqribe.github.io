        modal_text: "After School Club runs from 3.00pm to 6.30pm and offers children a wide range of activities.
                    These include role play, outdoor sports, various crafts, board games, construction, physical
                    play, cookery, and a quiet time for reading and homework. The children are expected to
                    participate in all aspects of the club, preparing snacks, tidying up and supporting each other,
                    where necessary, in order to develop independence. The children will be given access to
                    indoor and outdoor play, subject to weather conditions, seasonal time adjustments etc., so
                    please ensure they bring appropriate outdoor clothing.
                    We follow healthy eating guidelines and provide a variety of healthy snacks using fresh fruit
                    and vegetables, as well as a hot snack, such as soup or pasta, later in the session. Fresh
                    drinking water is available at all times. We attempt to meet individual dietary requirements
                    wherever possible. The food we provide at the Club is not intended as a substitute for a
                    main evening meal."
